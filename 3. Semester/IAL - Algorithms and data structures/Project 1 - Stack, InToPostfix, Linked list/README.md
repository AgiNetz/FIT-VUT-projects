This project consists of 3 separate parts where in each of them the task was to implement operations over data structures.
The project structure is as follows:
 - c202 - Implementation of operations over Stack
 - c204 - Conversion of infix notation to postfix notations
 - c206 - Implementation of operations over a linked list
