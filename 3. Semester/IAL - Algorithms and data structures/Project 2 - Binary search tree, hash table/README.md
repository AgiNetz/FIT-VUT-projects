 # Algorithms and data structures project 2 - Binary search tree and hash table
 
 The goal of this project to implement operations over data structures. The project consists of 2 parts and its structure is as follows:
 - c016 - Implement operations over a hash table
 - c401 - Implementation of operations over a binary search tree using recursion
 - c402 - Implementation of operations over a binary search tree without recursion
