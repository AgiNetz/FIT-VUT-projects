# IPK projects
In IPK, we were assigned 2 projects during the semester:
  * 1. Client-server application for retrieving user information
  * 2. Bandwidth measurement tool  
  
## 1. Client-server application for retrieving user information
The purpose of this project was to implement basic network communication and design a protocol  
for retrieving information about users from /etc/passwd on the server-side.

## 2. Bandwidth measurement tool
The purpose of this project was to implement a bandwidth measurement tool between two points. One side ran a "reflector" application  
which received and counted received packets. The other side ran a "prober" application which periodically flooded the network  
with UDP packets at varying rates. Based on their rate of loss, it estimated the bandwidth.
